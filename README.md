* Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records. 

* Final script reads in the csv file and displays the following:

  * The total number of months in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Below is the final analysis that is printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.
